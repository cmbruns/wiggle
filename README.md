# wiggle
another vr/desktop 3D visualization framework

This project is an attempt to consolidate a number of projects I worked on previously.

For example, I created a few example programs in pyopenvr, but those examples started to grow into new visualization research, which is definitely out of scope for what pyopenvr is supposed to be.

So next I created the vr_samples project to explore some of those ideas. But that project was a bit too ad hoc.

So I created this wiggle project.

I also want to incorporate some of the infrastructure from my other projects cinemol, moltk, swcimposters, plus some of the visualization techniques I implemented at HHMI, but which are not at the moment publically available on github.
