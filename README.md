# wiggle

Yet another vr/desktop 3D visualization framework.

This project is an attempt to consolidate a number of projects I worked on previously.

For example, I created a few example programs in [pyopenvr](https://github.com/cmbruns/pyopenvr) and [pyovr](), but those examples started to grow into new visualization research, which is definitely out of scope for what pyopenvr is supposed to be.

So next I created the [vr_samples](https://github.com/cmbruns/vr_samples) project to explore some of those ideas. But that project became a bit too ad hoc for my taste.

So I created this wiggle project.

I also want to incorporate some of the infrastructure from my other projects [cinemol](https://github.com/cmbruns/cinemol), [moltk](https://github.com/cmbruns/moltk), [swcimposters](https://github.com/cmbruns/swcimposters), plus some of the visualization techniques I implemented at HHMI, but which are not at the moment publically available on github.

Further, I expect wiggle to be a client of the projects [pyopenvr](https://github.com/cmbruns/pyopenvr) and [pyktx](https://github.com/cmbruns/pyktx).
